# USM-CS-Society-Merch-Clone

## Introduction

This repository contains code submitted for the Technical Evaluation of the CS Society 2023/2024 recruitment. The code is designed to replicate the website of [Merchandise | CS Society USM](https://merch.cssocietyusm.com/). The website clone was achieved by downloading the original site using Google Chrome(Save As Webpage Complete) and then making a few specific modifications as outlined below. 

## Modifications

The following modifications were made to the cloned code:

1. **Image Localization**: All images from the original website were replaced with local images.

2. **Hyperlink Changes**: Hyperlinks were modified as needed.

3. **Font Addition**: The "Bebas Neue" font was added to the website's title.

4. **JavaScript Addition**: A JavaScript was added for the "OK" button of "Shopping Cart" page, allowing users to return to the "Merchandise" page.

5. **Ongoing Work**: As of October 31, 2023, the implementation of the merch image glider is still a work in progress.

## How to Use

To view the cloned website, simply open the `Merchandise.html` file in a web browser. You can also explore the code and view the modifications made in the respective HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
